# Passwd_strength_checker

The password strength checker is a simple Java program that determines the strength of a password based on a set of predefined criteria. The program takes a password as input and assigns it a score based on its strength. The score is then used to determine whether the password is weak, medium, or strong.

# Features

- Determines the strength of a password based on a set of predefined criteria.
- Outputs a score indicating the strength of the password.
- Outputs a message indicating whether the password is weak, medium, or strong.

# Criteria

- Password length: The password must be between 8 and 15 characters long.
- Contains lowercase letters: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
- Contains uppercase letters: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
- Contains digits: The password must contain at least one digit.
- Contains symbols: The password must contain at least one symbol that is not a letter or digit.

# Usage

To use the password strength checker, simply run the program and enter a password when prompted. The program will then output the strength score and a message indicating whether the password is weak, medium, or strong.

# Improvements

While the password strength checker provides a simple way to determine the strength of a password, there are several ways in which it could be improved:

- Allow for customization of the criteria: Users may have different requirements for what constitutes a strong password, so allowing for customization of the criteria could improve the usefulness of the program.
- Provide suggestions for improving weak passwords: If a password is determined to be weak, the program could provide suggestions for how to improve it.
- Implement password hashing: While the password strength checker can help users generate strong passwords, it does not provide any protection for passwords that are stored in a database. Implementing password hashing would be a critical security improvement.

# Conclusion

Overall, the password strength checker provides a simple way to determine the strength of a password and encourage users to use stronger passwords. However, there are several ways in which the program could be improved to provide greater functionality and security.
